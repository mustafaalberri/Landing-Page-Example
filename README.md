## Project Description

This project is part of the Udacity course sponsored by FWD. The base HTML and CSS files were provided in the project givens, my main contribution was creating a Javascript program that turned the design of the website from static to dynamic. This is done by using Javascript programming to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) and its elements, making it an interactive experience for the user and responsive to all devices. In addition, I edited the HTML file by adding sections, and edited the CSS file to include more design features and media queries for a dynamic experience. I used asynchronous Javascript to achieve smooth transformations and transitions when dynamically changing the features of elements.

Some of the features that I added to create a dynamic and responsive website are:
- The navigation bar is created dynamically according to the number of sections.
- An active state is added to the section currently in the viewport.
- When clicking on a section name in the navigation bar, the page smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
- An active state is also added to the navigation bar items that correspond to the active section.
- All features are usable accross all devices, with a responsive layout and navigation bar.
- A dynamic navigation bar that is hidden when the user is not scrolling, it reappears when the user starts scrolling again or hovers over the navigation bar items.
- A 'Scroll to Top' button appears at the lower right corner, when the user scrolls below the fold of the page. 
- The contents of a section will dynamically collapse when the heading is pressed, it reappears when the heading is pressed again.
